## First-Time Setup
1. After uploading the code, the NodeMCU will create a WiFi access point named "NodeMCU-Setup"
2. Connect to this WiFi network
3. A configuration portal will open automatically
4. Enter your WiFi credentials
6. Save the configuration

## Operation

   - Press and hold the reset button for 5 seconds
   - The configuration portal will open again
2. If sensor readings are incorrect:
   - Check all connections
   - Verify power supply
   - Check sensor placement
3. If data isn't being sent to server:
   - Verify server is running
   - Check WiFi connection
   - Verify server URL in configuration
4. If Arduino IDE cannot detect NodeMCU:
   - Reinstall CH340 driver:
     1. Run CH34x_Install_Windows_v3_4.EXE
     2. Click "UNINSTALL"
     3. Click "INSTALL"
     4. Restart your computer
   - Check USB cable (try a different cable)
   - Try a different USB port
   - Verify the correct COM port is selected in Arduino IDE

## Testing Guide

### 1. Initial Testing
1. After setting up the hardware and software:
   - Power on the NodeMCU
   - Wait for the "NodeMCU-Setup" WiFi network to appear
   - Connect to the network and configure your WiFi
   - The device should automatically connect to your WiFi and discover the server

### 2. Sensor Testing
1. Temperature and Humidity (DHT11):
   - Place the sensor in a known environment (e.g., room temperature)
   - Verify readings match expected values:
     - Room temperature: 20-25¬∞C
     - Normal humidity: 30-60%
   - If readings are off, check connections and sensor placement

2. Gas Sensor (MQ-135):
   - Initial readings should be around 400-500 ppm for CO2
   - Place near a vegetable to see changes in readings
   - Baseline reading is taken during startup
   - Relative changes from baseline indicate gas levels

### 3. Server Testing
1. Verify server is running:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Check data reception:
   - Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/api/sensor-data`
   - Should see JSON data with temperature, humidity, CO2, ethylene, and vegetable type
3. Monitor server console for:
   - Connection logs
   - Data reception confirmations
   - Any error messages

### 4. Data Interpretation
The system determines vegetable type based on these thresholds:
- Carrot: Humidity ‚â• 95%, Temperature ‚â• 0¬∞C, CO2 ‚â• 400ppm
- Okra: Humidity ‚â• 90%, Temperature ‚â• 7¬∞C, CO2 ‚â• 400ppm
- Lettuce: Humidity ‚â• 95%, Temperature ‚â• 0¬∞C, CO2 ‚â• 400ppm

### 5. Common Test Scenarios
1. Fresh Vegetable Detection:
   - Place a fresh vegetable near sensors
   - Verify correct vegetable type is identified
   - Check readings are within expected ranges

2. Spoilage Detection:
   - Monitor readings over time
   - Look for changes in:
     - CO2 levels (increasing)
     - Ethylene levels (increasing)
     - Temperature (should remain stable)
     - Humidity (should remain stable)

3. Network Testing:
   - Test WiFi reconnection after power loss
   - Verify server discovery works
   - Check data transmission reliability

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### 1. Sensor Calibration
If sensor readings are consistently off:
1. DHT11:
   - Ensure sensor is not exposed to direct sunlight
   - Check for proper ventilation
   - Verify power supply stability

2. MQ-135:
   - Allow 24-48 hours for initial stabilization
   - Keep sensor away from direct airflow
   - Regular baseline recalibration may be needed

### 2. Network Issues
1. If NodeMCU fails to connect:
   - Check WiFi signal strength
   - Verify 2.4GHz network (5GHz not supported)
   - Ensure correct credentials

2. If server discovery fails:
   - Verify server is running
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure both devices are on same network

### 3. Data Transmission Issues
1. If data isn't being saved:
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify server logs
   - Check network connectivity

2. If readings are erratic:
   - Check power supply stability
   - Verify sensor connections
   - Look for electromagnetic interference

## IP Address Configuration

### Server IP Address
The server automatically detects and uses your local IP address. You can verify the correct IP address by:

1. Running the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Looking for these lines in the console output:
   ```
   üåê Access via your IP: http://YOUR_IP:3000/api/sensor-data
   üåê Server IP: YOUR_IP
   ```

### NodeMCU Configuration
The NodeMCU automatically discovers the server's IP address using UDP broadcast. No manual IP configuration is needed. The process works as follows:

1. When the NodeMCU starts, it:
   - Connects to WiFi
   - Broadcasts a discovery message
   - Receives the server's IP address
   - Automatically configures itself to use the correct server URL

2. If you need to change the server's IP address:
   - The NodeMCU will automatically detect the new IP on next restart
   - No code changes are needed in the Arduino sketch

### Testing the Connection
1. Start the server first
2. Power on the NodeMCU
3. Check the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Connected to WiFi
   üîç Searching for server...
   ‚úÖ Server found: YOUR_IP:3000
   ```

If the NodeMCU fails to find the server, it will automatically retry up to 3 times before restarting.

## Mobile App Configuration

### IP Address Setup
1. Open `src/pages/FridgeScreen.tsx`
2. Locate the fetch call (around line 100):
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('http://192.168.1.2:3000/api/sensor-data', {
   ```
3. Replace `192.168.1.2` with your server's IP address
4. Save the file and rebuild the app

Note: The IP address must match the one shown in your server console when you start the server. You can find this by looking for the line:
```
üåê Access via your IP: http://YOUR_IP:3000/api/sensor-data
```
